# Ansitovideo
This is project that transfers output of initframis to video, but in ASCII form.
## About 
- I created initframis, it works, but .full file is not supported as a video format and I had to do something.
- This script does transfer Initframis 1.1's output to mp4, webm or any other video format.
- Again, I don't know how is this supposed to work on Windows, other than a VM or WSL.
## Dependencies
- C++ libraries
- Ffmpeg
- C++ compiler, I am using g++
## Usage
- This program should be ran in any bash terminal, I think.
### Arguments
